# IHaveAStream

This is a **Stremio addon** that integrates external video streams into the platform.  

ðŸ”¹ **Current functionality**  
- Retrieves **m3u8** video streams from [Rojadirecta](https://www.rojadirecta.eu).  

ðŸ”¹ **Future goals**  
- The architecture is designed to be modular, making it easy to add **new streaming providers** beyond Rojadirecta.  
- The aim is to keep the addon flexible and expandable, supporting multiple content sources without changing the core logic.

## Project status
The project is currently in its early stage: it supports a single provider, but the structure is ready to grow.  

---

## Disclaimer
This addon does not host or distribute any content directly. It only collects streams already publicly available online through the integrated providers.  

---

## Limitations
At the moment, the addon **discards all m3u8 video streams that use encryption (e.g. AES-128, SAMPLE-AES)**.  

The reason is that, in most cases, access to decryption keys is deliberately made complicated by providers.  
Handling the different ways keys are distributed is complex and highly inconsistent, especially since there may be many providers with very different implementations.  

As a result, only **unencrypted streams** are processed and made available, while encrypted ones are skipped.
